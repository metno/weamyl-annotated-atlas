# Getting Started with React typescript boilerplate

This boilerplate should give you a good starting point when developing new frontend applications for MET.

The Material-UI theme is an implementation of MET visual profile. Most of the code is there to provide examples on
how to implement apps with React in typescript.

There is a room in [google chat](https://chat.google.com) called **MET - FAG - React** where we discuss React development at MET.
If you need access to the group, contact it-team-frontend@met.no

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all dependencies.\

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
